In this multicenter randomized controlled trial, rTMS was compared with the next pharmacological treatment step in patients with treatment-resistant depression. 0.3801757467444501\n",
      "id5 Clinical applications of Ashwagandha plant in depression and anxiety Ashwagandha is an adaptogenic herb that has been long used in traditional Indian medicine and has garnered attention in modern medicine in recent years. Known for its ability to restore balance in the body due to its adaptogenic properties, Ashwagandha is believed to offer potential benefits in addressing anxiety and depression, which are growing public health concerns in modern society. The bioactive components found in Ashwagandha, particularly withanolides, may contribute to reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression through various biological mechanisms that affect the nervous system. This can involve the regulation of neurotransmitters, anti-inflammatory effects, and support for stress coping mechanisms. The fact that Ashwagandha tends to cause fewer side effects compared to conventional antidepressants and anxiolytic drugs, along with its broad mechanism of action as a natural adaptogen, presents a significant advantage in terms of potential future therapeutic options. Many studies in the literature suggest that Ashwagandha could serve as a natural adjunct in these areas. However, more clinical trials and long-term effect analyses are necessary to fully evaluate this potential. This review aims to lay the groundwork for future research by assessing current literature on the effectiveness of Ashwagandha in addressing anxiety and depression. 0.39127561898034224\n",
      "id0 Does depression with current suicidal ideation lead to treatment-resistant depression? Two large naturalistic cohorts of outpatients with depression and current suicidal ideation As treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is linked to suicidal behaviors and suicidal risk is a predictor of TRD, depression with current suicidal ideation (SI) may lead to TRD. Early identification of TRD risk factors in patients with depression and current SI is crucial. The aims of our study were: i) to identify risk factors for depression non-remission and TRD in patients with depression and current SI; ii) to assess if SI at baseline mediated the relationship between depression severity at baseline and depression remission at week 6. We analyzed data from two large, prospective, naturalistic French cohorts of adult outpatients with depression (DSM-IV criteria) followed for 6 weeks after starting or changing antidepressants (LUEUR and GENESE). Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, along with early symptom improvement, were compared between patients with and without current SI using logistic regression models (univariate and multivariate). Patients with antidepressant change or initiation were analyzed separately. Those without depression remission at week 6 after an antidepressant change were considered TRD cases. In patients with antidepressant change, the major predictor of non-remission was poorer early improvement (at week 2) of anxiety. For patients with treatment initiation, SI at baseline mediated the relation between depression severity at baseline and depression remission. Depression severity at baseline alone did not explain depression remission. Clinicians should systematically target with specific pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments anxiety and SI and assess their changes in the short term to increase the chance of depression remission in depressed patients with current SI. 0.4300102363573356\n"

      "Title and abstract: ['Anxiety Disorders: Emotions, Emotion Regulation and Treatment Methods We experience many emotions in daily life and these emotions play a vital role in many areas of life. While these emotions are mostly normal and functional, excessive, intense and prolonged emotions can seriously damage the functionality of the person. When we take a look at the list of disorders under the title of anxiety disorders, it is seen that emotional processes have a significant effect in each of these areas. However, contrary to popular belief, it is known that not only some core emotions such as anxiety and fear, but also disgust, anger, guilt and shame have a role to be considered. In this study, the role of these emotions and emotion regulation skills in anxiety disorders is discussed. Subsequently, how Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Metacognitive therapy address emotions in psychotherapy when working with anxiety disorders is briefly mentioned. This study is intended to provide a basis for a better understanding of the role of emotions in psychotherapy and to offer new perspectives for studies in this field.']\n"
